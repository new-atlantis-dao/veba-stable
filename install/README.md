### Installation and Database Configuration Guide
____________________________________________________________
#### Software installation
One issue with having large-scale pipeline suites with open-source software is the issue of dependencies.  One solution for this is to have a modular software structure where each module has its own `conda` environment.  This allows for minimizing dependency constraints as this software suite uses an array of diverse packages from different developers. 

The basis for these environments is creating a separate environment for each module with the `VEBA-` prefix and `_env` as the suffix.  For example `VEBA-assembly_env` or `VEBA-binning-prokaryotic_env`.  Because of this, `VEBA` is currently not available as a `conda` package but each module will be in the near future.  In the meantime, please use the `veba/install/install_veba.sh` script which installs each environment from the yaml files in `veba/install/environments/`. After installing the environments, use the `veba/install/download_databases.sh` script to download and configure the databases while also adding the environment variables to the activate/deactivate scripts in each environment.  To install anything manually, just read the scripts as they are well documented and refer to different URL and paths for specific installation options.

The majority of the time taken to build database is downloading/decompressing large archives, `Diamond` database creation of `UniRef`, and `MMSEQS2` database creation of microeukaryotic protein database.

Total size is `243 GB` but if you have certain databases installed already then you can just symlink them so the `VEBA_DATABASE` path has the correct structure.  Note, the exact size may vary as Pfam and UniRef are updated regularly.

Each major version will be packaged as a [release](https://github.com/jolespin/veba/releases) which will include a log of module and script versions.

### VEBA Database: 

Please refer to the [VEBA Database](DATABASE.md) documentation.
___________________

### Install:

Currently, **Conda environments for VEBA are ONLY configured for Linux** and, due to the large databases, this software was designed to be used via HPC. 

**There are 3 steps to install *VEBA*:**

* Download repository from GitHub

* Install conda environments

* Download/configure databases

**0. Clean up your conda installation [Optional, but recommended]**

The `VEBA` installation is going to configure some `conda` environments for you and some of them have quite a bit of packages.  To minimize the likelihood of [weird errors](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/valueerror-unsupported-format-character-t-0x54-at-index-3312-when-creating-environment-from-environment-file/25237), it's recommended to do the following:


* Use this as your [`~/.condarc`](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html).  If you're not familiar with the `.condarc` file, then you probably don't have one configured.  You can use an editor like [nano](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nano) (which is what I use), [vim](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vim), or [emacs](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/emacs) to copy/paste the following into [`~/.condarc`](condarc).
	
	```
	channel_priority: flexible
	channels:
	  - conda-forge
	  - bioconda
	  - jolespin
	  - defaults
	  - qiime2
		
	report_errors: true
	```
	
* Make sure your `conda` is [initialized](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/init.html). I use `bash` for my initialization.  
	
	```
	conda init bash
	```
	
	
* Clean up your `conda` environment with the following command.
	
	```
	conda clean --all -y
	```
	
* Update your `conda`.
	
	```
	conda update -n base --all -y
	```
	
* Install and update [`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
	
	```
	conda install -c conda-forge mamba -y
	conda update mamba -y
	```

**1. Download repository**

```
# For stable version, download and decompress the tarball:

VERSION="1.3.0"
wget https://github.com/jolespin/veba/archive/refs/tags/v${VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -xvf v${VERSION}.tar.gz && mv veba-${VERSION} veba

# For developmental version, clone the repository:
# git clone https://github.com/jolespin/veba/

# Update the permissions
chmod 755 veba/src/*.py
chmod 755 veba/src/scripts/*
chmod 755 veba/install/*.sh

# Go into the install directory
cd veba/install
``` 

**2. Install VEBA environments**

**Recommended resource allocatation:** 4 hours with 15 GB memory (include extra time for variable I/O speed for various hosts)

The update from `CheckM1` -> `CheckM2` and installation of `antiSMASH` require more memory and may require grid access if head node is limited.

```
bash install_veba.sh
```

**3. Activate the database conda environment, download, and configure databases**

**Recommended resource allocatation:**  48 GB memory (time is dependent on I/O of database repositories)

⚠️ **This step should use ~48 GB memory** and should be run using a compute grid via SLURM or SunGridEngine.  If this command is run on the head node it will likely fail or timeout if a connection is interrupted. The most computationally intensive steps are creating a `Diamond` database of `UniRef` and a `MMSEQS2` database of the microeukaryotic protein database.  Note the duration will depend on several factors including your internet connection speed and the I/O of public repositories.

**Future releases will split the downloading and configuration to better make use of resources.**

If issues arise, please [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jolespin/veba/issues) prefixed with `[Database]`. We are here to help :)

**If you are running an interactive queue:**

```
conda activate VEBA-database_env

bash download_databases.sh /path/to/veba_database
```

**If you use job scheduling (e.g., sbatch or qsub):**

[If you're unfamiliar with SLURM or SunGridEnginer, we got you](https://github.com/jolespin/veba/blob/main/walkthroughs/README.md#basics).  

Running `conda activate` on a compute server might prompt you to run `conda init` even if you've already initilized on the head node.  To get around this you can use `source activate [environment]`.  Using the `source activate` command requires you to be in `base` conda environment.  You can do this via `conda deactivate` or `conda activate base` before you submit your job.  

Below is an example of how to do this: 

```
# Activate your base environment
conda activate base

# Set the number of threads you want to use.  
# Keep in mind that not all steps are parallelized (e.g., wget)
N_JOBS=1

# Create a log directory
mkdir -p logs/

# Set name for log files when running on the grid
N="database_config"

# Adapt your command to a one-liner
CMD="source activate VEBA-database_env && bash download_databases.sh /path/to/veba_database"
	
# Note: You should either use SunGridEngine or SLURM not both. 
# You might need to adapt slightly but these worked on our systems.

# SunGridEngine:
qsub -o logs/${N}.o -e logs/${N}.e -cwd -N ${N} -j y -pe threaded ${N_JOBS} "${CMD}"
	
# SLURM:
# For SLURM you might need to specify which account and partition you are associated with for grid jobs
PARTITION=[partition name]
ACCOUNT=[account name]

sbatch -A ${ACCOUNT} -p ${PARTITION} -J ${N} -N 1 -c ${N_JOBS} --ntasks-per-node=1 -o logs/${N}.o -e logs/${N}.e --export=ALL -t 12:00:00 --mem=64G --wrap="${CMD}"
```

Now, you should have the following environments:

```
VEBA-annotate_env
VEBA-assembly_env
VEBA-binning-eukaryotic_env
VEBA-binning-prokaryotic_env
VEBA-binning-viral_env
VEBA-biosynthetic_env
VEBA-classify_env
VEBA-cluster_env
VEBA-database_env
VEBA-mapping_env
VEBA-phylogeny_env
VEBA-preprocess_env
VEBA-profile_env
```
All the environments should have the `VEBA_DATABASE` environment variable set. If not, then add it manually to ~/.bash_profile: `export VEBA_DATABASE=/path/to/veba_database`.

You can check to make sure the `conda` environments were created and all of the environment variables were created using the following command:

```
bash check_installation.sh
```

Future versions will have `bioconda` installation available.

#### Alternatively, if you just need to update environment variables with existing database:

```
bash update_environment_variables.sh
```

**If you want to use containerized versions:**

Please refer to the [adapting commands for Docker walkthrough](https://github.com/jolespin/veba/blob/main/walkthroughs/adapting_commands_for_docker.md).

Docker containers are now available (starting with `v1.1.2`) for all modules via [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/jolespin)

### Uninstall:

**There are 2 steps to uninstall *VEBA*:**

* Remove conda environments

* Remove database directory

```
# Remove conda enivronments
bash uninstall_veba.sh

# Remove VEBA database
rm -rfv /path/to/veba_database
```
____________________________________________________________

### Updating VEBA: 

There are currently 2 ways to update veba:

1. Basic uninstall reinstall - You can uninstall and reinstall using the scripts in `veba/install/` directory.  It's recomended to do a fresh reinstall when updating from `v1.0.x` → `v1.2.x`.
2. Patching existing installation - Complete reinstalls of *VEBA* environments and databases is time consuming so [we've detailed how to do specific patches **for advanced users**](PATCHES.md). If you don't feel comfortable running these commands, then just do a fresh install if you would like to update.
